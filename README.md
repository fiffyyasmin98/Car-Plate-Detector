Car Plate Detector is written using basic opencv ,tkinter and other techniques in Digital Image Processing field of study. The concept is to build and develop a one-click solution object detection application. The application should be able to find the width,height and size of detected objects. The application should be also able to detect one character from the detected object, compare size of each detected object, apply thinning techniques and replace canny edge dtection techniques with prewitt and sobel.
